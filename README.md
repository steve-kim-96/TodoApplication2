# TodoApplication2

When you start learning a new language and framework, what's the best basic project that helps you understand the basic principles? 
A Todo application. This todo application is just me practising some things like Entity Framework, .Net Core MVC, C#, LINQ, and other things that don't come to mind immediately.


Expectation?
Learn as much as I can of the basics; Understand the basic principles and technologies and spring board off of this to create a slightly more challenging application.
